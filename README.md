# PC2MQTT
 Control and monitor your PC through MQTT. Using cs-script, "sensors" are C# scripts compiled at runtime capable of most anything you can think of. Example included. The idea is to support many sensors but also the ability to expand quickly and easily.
 
A big project goal will be cross-platform, so .Net Core 3.1 is being used.
